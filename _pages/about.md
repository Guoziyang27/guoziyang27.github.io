Hello! I'm Ziyang Guo. I'm a thrid-year PhD student in [Computer Science at Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/graduate/phd/). Currently, I work with Professor [Jessica Hullman](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/) at [MU Colective](https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/). Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

My research develop theoretical frameworks for reasoning about information-assisted behavior such as reliance in human-AI decision making. My work
grounds in human-computer interaction, statistical decision theory and machine learning.
