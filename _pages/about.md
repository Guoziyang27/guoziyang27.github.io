Hello! I'm Ziyang Guo. I'm a second-year PhD student in [Computer Science at Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/graduate/phd/). Currently, I work with Professor [Jessica Hullman](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/) at [MU Colective](https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/). Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

My research interests lie in HCI and statistical decision theory. Currently, I work on statistical workflows, and specifically on experiment design and evaluation of information, under a statistical decision theory framework.
